What do you hope to get out of this course: I have had a very complicated relationship with programming with my CSE courses, but I lived through the obvious weed out classes and want to explore some other domains before I go back to doing CSE. For clarity, I hope to get the necessary experience to competently approach Data Science, and further explore the possibilities of object oriented coding. This will give me a more grounded approach to programming, which I assert will make tracking my growth more feasible.

What is your previous programming experience: I have gone through most of the cirriculum regarding C and I have done remedial projects like making games or even menus to purchase movie tickets via linked lists & queues.
